One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments.

shifts, insufficient training and experiences, and the prevailing mindsets that discourage people
from learning to lead. Leadership potential isnt something that some people have and other
people dont. Its much more broadly distributed than traditionally accepted views suggest.
Learning to become exemplary leaders, exercising greater leadership, is essential across all
types of organizations, settings, and circumstances because it makes a significant difference in
peoples levels of engagement, commitment, and performance. Developing greater leadership
capabilities will not only promote more productive organizations but also enhances feelings of
self-worth and meaningfulness. As the late management guru Peter Drucker explained: Only
three things happen naturally in organizations: Friction, confusion, and under-performance.
Everything else requires leadership.

Dynamic Programming and Markov Decision Processes, which originated more than fifty
years ago. But in recent years, the use of Deep Learning algorithms to RL systems, known
as Deep Reinforcement Learning, has led to big gains in performance for applications
such in Robotics, Quantitative Finance and Game Playing systems.
In the first half of the course we start by discussing Markov Decision Processes, Dynamic
Programming algorithms and the concept of Value Functions. We introduce the idea of
Reinforcement Learning as a way to do optimal control in cases when a system model is
not available and information about the Value Function is obtained by analyzing its sample
paths. RL Algorithms such as Monte Carlo based learning, Temporal Difference Learning
and Q-Learning are discussed in detail. Concepts such as on-policy and off-policy
learning, policy exploration vs exploitation are also explained.
In the second half of the course we introduce the idea of using Deep Learning Neural
Networks as function approximators for RL systems, which leads to a large increase in the
complexity of systems that can be handled using RL. The Deep Q Network (DQN)
algorithm is discussed in detail. We then discuss Policy Gradient methods such as the
REINFORCE algorithm, and then combine Value Function and Policy Gradient methods
together and come up with Actor-Critic Algorithms. We also discuss Model based RL,
which results in the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Applications of these
concepts in the areas of Game Playing systems, Finance and Robotics are also
discussed."
