This course focuses on the processes by which managers position their businesses to create and sustain an advantage relative to rivals in the face of uncertainty, rapid change, and competition. Strategy involves understanding the utility of different choices and tradeoffs -- choosing what not to do is as important as choosing what to do. As a result, the course will expose you to frameworks and concepts for analyzing a firm's environment and competitive position to inform the strategic decision making process. By uncovering the factors that make some strategic positions strong and viable, we shall develop the ability to evaluate the effects of changes in resources & capabilities, industry forces, macro-environmental forces, and technology on industry structure and firm behavior and, in turn, on a firm's opportunities for creating, capturing and sustaining superior profits relative to rivals.",

2019,Fall,IDIS,3799,Managing Transitions,"Brock,Phyllis S",1,Managing Transitions,"The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.","MBA and 30 units  (Includes test and transfer units, and units in progress)"

This course focuses on the processes by which managers position their businesses to create and sustain an advantage relative to rivals in the face of uncertainty, rapid change, and competition. Strategy involves understanding the utility of different choices and tradeoffs -- choosing what not to do is as important as choosing what to do. As a result, the course will expose you to frameworks and concepts for analyzing a firm's environment and competitive position to inform the strategic decision making process. By uncovering the factors that make some strategic positions strong and viable, we shall develop the ability to evaluate the effects of changes in resources & capabilities, industry forces, macro-environmental forces, and technology on industry structure and firm behavior and, in turn, on a firm's opportunities for creating, capturing and sustaining superior profits relative to rivals.",

One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.","MBA and 30 units  (Includes test and transfer units, and units in progress)"

Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.","MBA and 30 units  (Includes test and transfer units, and units in progress)"

One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.","MBA and 30 units  (Includes test and transfer units, and units in progress)"

Marketers,  in  turn,  are  using  social  media  to  not  only  gain  insights   from  their  customers  but  also  connect  and  communicate  them.  Currently,  it  is  critical  for  most  marketers  to   have  a  social  media  presence  as  they  leverage  this  platform  to  grow  their  business.      
This  course  focuses  on  how  marketers  can  translate  insights  from  social  media  data  into  actionable  marketing   strategies  and  tactics.  We  first  need  to  understand  the  basics  of  social  media,  viral  marketing,  and  data   generation.  We  will  explore  who  is  posting  content  and  why  are  they  posting.  Second,  we  will  learn  how  to   analyze  data  generated  through  social  media.  This  includes  both  numerical  such  as  Amazon  ratings,  Facebook   likes,  and  Twitter  tweets  and  textual  such  as  the  comments  written  on  Facebook,  blogs,  and  many  other  social   media  platforms.  Finally,  we  will  focus  on  actionable  marketing  decisions  based  on  the  social  media  data   analysis.  This  includes  responding  to  user  comments  or  integrating  social  media  marketing  with  traditional   paid  media.    
The  intention  of  this  course  is  to  provide  you  with  a  solid  foundation  for  social  media  marketing  as  a  user  of   analytics-­based  information  and  reporting.  The  course  is  not  designed  to  teach  you  how  each  social  media   platform  works.

One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.","MBA and 30 units  (Includes test and transfer units, and units in progress)"

2020,Winter,IDIS,3799,Managing Transitions,"Cannon,Maria Baron",1,Managing Transitions,"The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.","MBA and 30 units  (Includes test and transfer units, and units in progress)"

people, eagerness, resources, and capabilities exist. The shortage is a result of demographic
shifts, insufficient training and experiences, and the prevailing mindsets that discourage people
from learning to lead. Leadership potential isnt something that some people have and other
people dont. Its much more broadly distributed than traditionally accepted views suggest.
Learning to become exemplary leaders, exercising greater leadership, is essential across all
types of organizations, settings, and circumstances because it makes a significant difference in
peoples levels of engagement, commitment, and performance. Developing greater leadership
capabilities will not only promote more productive organizations but also enhances feelings of
self-worth and meaningfulness. As the late management guru Peter Drucker explained: Only
three things happen naturally in organizations: Friction, confusion, and under-performance.
Everything else requires leadership.
Through lectures, field work, experiential exercises, readings, and reflective essays students will
develop their facility and acumen in using a leadership operating system. The course provides a
systematic opportunity to practice and receive feedback on your leadership behaviors through
instrumented 360-degree feedback as well as peer coaching.
Upon successful completion of the course, students will be capable of:
1. Articulating their philosophy of leadership
2. Explaining an operating system for leadership
3. Describing their leadership capabilities
4. Building strong relationships with constituents
5. Coaching themselves and others in leadership practices

people, eagerness, resources, and capabilities exist. The shortage is a result of demographic
shifts, insufficient training and experiences, and the prevailing mindsets that discourage people
from learning to lead. Leadership potential isnt something that some people have and other
people dont. Its much more broadly distributed than traditionally accepted views suggest.
Learning to become exemplary leaders, exercising greater leadership, is essential across all
types of organizations, settings, and circumstances because it makes a significant difference in
peoples levels of engagement, commitment, and performance. Developing greater leadership
capabilities will not only promote more productive organizations but also enhances feelings of
self-worth and meaningfulness. As the late management guru Peter Drucker explained: Only
three things happen naturally in organizations: Friction, confusion, and under-performance.
Everything else requires leadership.
Through lectures, field work, experiential exercises, readings, and reflective essays students will
develop their facility and acumen in using a leadership operating system. The course provides a
systematic opportunity to practice and receive feedback on your leadership behaviors through
instrumented 360-degree feedback as well as peer coaching.
Upon successful completion of the course, students will be capable of:
1. Articulating their philosophy of leadership
2. Explaining an operating system for leadership
3. Describing their leadership capabilities
4. Building strong relationships with constituents
5. Coaching themselves and others in leadership practices

Marketers,  in  turn,  are  using  social  media  to  not  only  gain  insights   from  their  customers  but  also  connect  and  communicate  them.  Currently,  it  is  critical  for  most  marketers  to   have  a  social  media  presence  as  they  leverage  this  platform  to  grow  their  business.      
This  course  focuses  on  how  marketers  can  translate  insights  from  social  media  data  into  actionable  marketing   strategies  and  tactics.  We  first  need  to  understand  the  basics  of  social  media,  viral  marketing,  and  data   generation.  We  will  explore  who  is  posting  content  and  why  are  they  posting.  Second,  we  will  learn  how  to   analyze  data  generated  through  social  media.  This  includes  both  numerical  such  as  Amazon  ratings,  Facebook   likes,  and  Twitter  tweets  and  textual  such  as  the  comments  written  on  Facebook,  blogs,  and  many  other  social   media  platforms.  Finally,  we  will  focus  on  actionable  marketing  decisions  based  on  the  social  media  data   analysis.  This  includes  responding  to  user  comments  or  integrating  social  media  marketing  with  traditional   paid  media.    
The  intention  of  this  course  is  to  provide  you  with  a  solid  foundation  for  social  media  marketing  as  a  user  of   analytics-­based  information  and  reporting.  The  course  is  not  designed  to  teach  you  how  each  social  media   platform  works.  Rather,  the  broad  objective  is  to  provide  you  with  a  perspective  on  how  data-­based  insights   can  and  should  be  used  to  make  marketing  decisions  and  a  set  of  skills  for  analyzing  common  types  of  social   marketing  data  in  order  to  generate  meaningful  insights.",(MKTG 3000 OR MKTG 3552 OR MKTG 551 OR MKTG 2552 OR MKTG 856) AND (MBAMBAMJ OR MBAJDMMJ OR MBAWKENDMJ)

2019,Summer,MSIS,2806,Reinforcement Learning,"Varma,Subir",2,Reinforcement Learning,"The objective of this course is to provide an in-depth introduction to the topic of
Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. These algorithms are based on the theory of
Dynamic Programming and Markov Decision Processes, which originated more than fifty
years ago. But in recent years, the use of Deep Learning algorithms to RL systems, known
as Deep Reinforcement Learning, has led to big gains in performance for applications
such in Robotics, Quantitative Finance and Game Playing systems.
In the first half of the course we start by discussing Markov Decision Processes, Dynamic
Programming algorithms and the concept of Value Functions. We introduce the idea of
Reinforcement Learning as a way to do optimal control in cases when a system model is
not available and information about the Value Function is obtained by analyzing its sample
paths. RL Algorithms such as Monte Carlo based learning, Temporal Difference Learning
and Q-Learning are discussed in detail. Concepts such as on-policy and off-policy
learning, policy exploration vs exploitation are also explained.
In the second half of the course we introduce the idea of using Deep Learning Neural
Networks as function approximators for RL systems, which leads to a large increase in the
complexity of systems that can be handled using RL. The Deep Q Network (DQN)
algorithm is discussed in detail. We then discuss Policy Gradient methods such as the
REINFORCE algorithm, and then combine Value Function and Policy Gradient methods
together and come up with Actor-Critic Algorithms. We also discuss Model based RL,
which results in the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm. Applications of these
concepts in the areas of Game Playing systems, Finance and Robotics are also
discussed.",MSBUSAMJ Academic Plan Only

2019,Summer,IDIS,3799,Managing Transitions,"Cannon,Maria Baron",1,Managing Transitions,"The course is based on critical transitions, formative experiences, and personal conflict that characterize the common challenges MBAs are likely to face as they progress in their careers. One objective is to help students gain a more robust understanding of some of the pitfalls they may encounter as they make transitions within or across organizations. Research demonstrates that career failures are often associated with individual failures to successfully make these transitions. Blending theory and practice sessions will illustrate the lessons learned by others (such as SV executives) that have sometimes stumbled in making what seem to be straightforward transitions. Why are transitions challenging? Typically transitions require learning new skills and strategies for managing people who have different responsibilities, needs, goals and expectations than the individual has led in the past. For example, the role as individual team member vs. managing a team requires a shift in mindset from getting a job done through personal skills and effort to getting work done through others; shifting from a manager to a leader requires a shift in attention from focusing on doing things right to doing the right things. Such transitions often mean letting go of the very things that have made us successful in the past and deriving satisfaction from others accomplishments. Although easy to understand conceptually, this marks a fundamental shift in individuals identities.","MBA and 30 units  (Includes test and transfer units, and units in progress)"
